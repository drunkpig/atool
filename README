atool - Introduction
====================

atool is a script for managing file archives of various types (tar,
tar+gzip, zip etc).

The main command is aunpack which extracts files from an archive. Did you
ever extract files from an archive, not checking whether the files were
located in a subdirectory or in the top directory of the archive, resulting
in files scattered all over the place? aunpack overcomes this problem by
first extracting to a new directory. If there was only a single file in the
archive, that file is moved to the original directory. aunpack also
prevents local files from being overwritten by mistake.

The other commands provided are apack (to create archives), als (to list
files in archives), and acat (to extract files to standard out). As atool
invokes external programs to handle the archives, not all commands may be
supported for a certain type of archives.

atool identifies archives by their file extension. Sometimes this is not
possible - for instance rar archives usually have varying numeric file
extensions. In those cases when atool can't identify the format, file is
used instead. (atool can be configured not to use file.)

atool is written in Perl by Oskar Liljeblad and is free software (GNU

Building
========

To build all files, simply run

   ./configure

The configure script accepts a few options - use the following command to
show them:

   ./configure --help

Installation
============

Installing atool is a matter of copying the atool file to some appropriate
directory for executable files, usually /usr/local/bin. After that,
symbolic links for apack, aunpack, als and acat to atool should be created
in the same directory.

All this can be done automaticly by running

   make install

It is possible to create a system wide configuration file overriding
default values found in the top of the atool script (see below).

Usage and Configuration
=======================

A list of options that atool accepts can be displayed by running atool with
the --help option:

   atool --help

Please see the manual page for atool for full use and configuration
information. This document can usually be viewed this way:

   man ./atool.1

Supported formats
=================

Please see the supplied manual page, as described above.

Homepage
========

Web site and file area for atool is hosted on Savannah:

   http://www.nongnu.org/atool/
