Description: A script for managing file archives of various types
 atool is a script for managing file archives of various types (tar,
 tar+gzip, zip etc).
 .
 The main command is aunpack which extracts files from an archive. Did you
 ever extract files from an archive, not checking whether the files were
 located in a subdirectory or in the top directory of the archive, resulting
 in files scattered all over the place? aunpack overcomes this problem by
 first extracting to a new directory. If there was only a single file in the
 archive, that file is moved to the original directory. aunpack also
 prevents local files from being overwritten by mistake.
 .
 The other commands provided are apack (to create archives), als (to list
 files in archives), and acat (to extract files to standard out). As atool
 invokes external programs to handle the archives, not all commands may be
 supported for a certain type of archives.
